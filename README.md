Smart Contract for marriages

Key Concepts for the Smart Contract
Participants Verification (KYC):
Before entering into the contract, both parties must go through a third-party identity verification system to confirm they are who they claim to be. This can be integrated with external oracles, such as a KYC provider, to confirm their identity on-chain.
Third-party Verification:
You’ll need a set of trusted third parties, such as arbitrators or oracles, who can validate key actions or inputs such as finances, housing conditions, personal care, or other aspects defined in the agreement.
Automatic Renewal and Term Timelines:
The contract would automatically renew annually unless one or both parties choose to exit. The timelines and contract duration can be defined in the contract, with automatic notifications sent to both parties.
Vesting Mechanism:
To encourage meeting goals, there could be vesting schedules based on shared milestones. These milestones can include financial achievements, shared ventures, housing, personal care, or others. If a party fulfills a milestone, a portion of the coin can vest (become available), and both parties can unlock portions of their earnings or funds.
Operating Agreement:
The smart contract would include a thorough operating agreement outlining all the responsibilities and expectations between the parties (finances, children, business ventures, etc.).
Tokenized Investment:
You can issue a token that investors can buy into. This token can appreciate as the relationship and shared goals progress, and parties involved in the agreement can reward or penalize based on their progress.

Key Functionalities:
Third-Party Verification: Uses oracles or KYC systems to verify the participants.
Contract Renewal: The contract auto-renews each year, as specified.
Vesting and Goal Tracking: Rewards participants by unlocking coins based on milestones or goals they achieve.
Investing in the Contract: Investors can buy into the agreement and earn tokens based on the relationship's progress.
Operating Agreement: Details responsibilities for finance, personal care, business ventures, etc.
Key Technologies:
Bitcoin SV Smart Contracts: While BSV doesn’t have a typical “smart contract” system like Ethereum, it uses the Tokenized protocol and its Script language for custom operations. You could use a Layer 2 protocol or an off-chain system that tracks these kinds of events.
Oracles: Use external sources to verify identities, milestones, or other real-world conditions.
Next Steps:
Development: A smart contract developer would need to implement this using a proper blockchain environment.
Security Audit: Ensure that the contract is secure, preventing misuse or errors in the contract’s logic.
Legal and Compliance: Since this would be tied to real-world agreements, ensure the terms meet legal requirements in your jurisdiction.
This is a highly conceptual contract, and actual implementation will need further refinement, especially in terms of the legal binding and the way BSV smart contracts and Tokenized work in practice.
