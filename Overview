To create a BSV (Bitcoin SV) smart contract using sCrypt (the programming language for smart contracts on BSV), we'll need to define the structure of the contract and allow for flexible input options such as:

Participants (party A and party B)
Contract term, renewal, and expiration dates
Financial contributions, milestones, and vesting schedule
Third-party verification (KYC)
Agreement clauses (e.g., finances, children, housing, etc.)
Ability to invest and mint tokens
BSV smart contracts are written using sCrypt, which is a Turing-complete, stack-based language that works specifically for Bitcoin SV. Below is an implementation of a sCrypt smart contract to handle a dating or marriage contract with various customizable inputs.

Overview of the contract structure:
Parties: Party A (address) and Party B (address)
Contract duration: Start date, end date, and renewal term
Milestones and Vesting: Each party can meet milestones and unlock tokens based on progress
Verification: Using a simple check for KYC (this would be a placeholder for an actual verification oracle in a real implementation)
Investments: Investors can invest in the contract and receive a share based on the contract's goals.
