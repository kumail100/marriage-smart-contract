To create a BSV (Bitcoin SV) smart contract using sCrypt (the programming language for smart contracts on BSV), we'll need to define the structure of the contract and allow for flexible input options such as:

Participants (party A and party B)
Contract term, renewal, and expiration dates
Financial contributions, milestones, and vesting schedule
Third-party verification (KYC)
Agreement clauses (e.g., finances, children, housing, etc.)
Ability to invest and mint tokens
BSV smart contracts are written using sCrypt, which is a Turing-complete, stack-based language that works specifically for Bitcoin SV. Below is an implementation of a sCrypt smart contract to handle a dating or marriage contract with various customizable inputs.

Overview of the contract structure:
Parties: Party A (address) and Party B (address)
Contract duration: Start date, end date, and renewal term
Milestones and Vesting: Each party can meet milestones and unlock tokens based on progress
Verification: Using a simple check for KYC (this would be a placeholder for an actual verification oracle in a real implementation)
Investments: Investors can invest in the contract and receive a share based on the contract's goals.

Explanation of Key Components
Participants (partyA, partyB):
These are the two addresses involved in the contract. Each address represents one party.
Contract Terms:
startDate, endDate, and renewalTerm control when the contract starts and ends. The renewal term is in seconds (e.g., 365 days = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60).
Financial Contributions:
Both participants can set their financial contributions, and these are tracked individually (financialContributionsA, financialContributionsB).
Milestones:
Each participant can contribute to milestones (milestonesAchievedA, milestonesAchievedB). When a milestone is met, coins are unlocked based on the vesting schedule.
Vesting Mechanism:
When a participant achieves a milestone, they unlock a portion of their coins. This is just a mock implementation (vestCoins).
Investors:
External investors can invest in the contract. Their investments are tracked with a mapping (investorBalance), and they receive rewards based on their investment.
Third-Party Verification:
A placeholder verify function is used to simulate KYC verification. In a real-world scenario, an oracle service would be used to verify the identities of both parties.
Exit Function:
The exitContract function allows either party to exit the contract, deactivating it.
Contract Renewal:
The contract can be renewed automatically when it reaches its end date.
Agreement Clause:
The contract can contain terms and conditions stored in the agreementClause string. This could be updated at any time.
Next Steps
Token Minting: The smart contract assumes token minting would be integrated with a separate token system (Tokenized Protocol or similar).
Real-World Oracle Integration: A real-world Oracle (e.g., for KYC or external verification) can be integrated.
Security & Testing: Full security audits should be conducted on the contract before any real use.
Legal Review: Ensure that all contract terms are legally sound and compliant.
This is just a starting point and demonstrates how you can integrate various aspects like verification, milestones, vesting, and external investments into a smart contract using sCrypt.
